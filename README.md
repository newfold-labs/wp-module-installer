An installer for WordPress plugins and themes.

## Module Responsibilities

- Store a list of valid WordPress, Newfold, and custom URL plugins and themes, hereinafter referred to as valid plugins and themes.
- Provide REST API endpoints to install and/or activate valid plugins and themes synchronously or asynchronously (using WP_Cron).
- Provide REST API endpoints to check the status of asynchronous requests and functionality to expedite them.
- Provide Service classes that contain all the functionality which can be used independently of the REST API.
- Provide flexibility to install and activate valid plugins and themes synchronously or asynchronously (using WP_Cron).


## Critical Paths

- If a user requests a valid plugin or theme installation/activation, it should be completed successfully.
- If a user requests an invalid/non-approved plugin or theme installation/activation, it should fail.
- If a user requests to asynchronously install/activate an approved plugin or theme, then the API returns the correct status of the request in the queue.
- If a user requests to expedite an asynchronously queued valid plugin or theme installation/activation, then it must be completed successfully without affecting other requests.

## Releases

### 1. Bump Version [IMPORTANT]

Run the command `npm run set-version-bump`. This command will automatically
- Bump version constants in the proper files:
  - `includes/Data/Constants.php`: (NFD_INSTALLER_VERSION) 
  - `package.json`: version
- Clear old build files
- Create new build files
- Update language/i18n files as needed 

## Installation

### 1. Add the Newfold Satis to your `composer.json`.

 ```bash
 composer config repositories.newfold composer https://newfold-labs.github.io/satis
 ```

### 2. Require the `newfold-labs/wp-module-installer` package.

 ```bash
 composer require newfold-labs/wp-module-installer
